## Hello!

I am a computer science graduate from King's College London who is currently working for Channable in Utrecht, The Netherlands as a Python development.

## About me

My MSc. thesis was focussed on medical robotics and I worked on improving the movement algorithms of a small robotic worm, this involved implementing biomimicry techniques. I worked on creating these algorithms by studying how earth worms move, this process is known as peristaltic locomotion and involves energy moving along a cylindircal object to achieve locomotion. I was able to classify data from input sensors of the worm such as a gyroscope, accelerometer and camera, and was then able to adapt the algorithm the worm was using to move.
